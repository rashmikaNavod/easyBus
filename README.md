## Project Description
The Sri Lanka Bus Management System is a web-based platform designed to improve public transportation by providing real-time bus tracking and management. Built with Mapbox API, the system allows users to view bus locations and routes without relying on GPS technology. Instead, live location updates are provided by passengers at bus stands, bus drivers, or bus assistants using the website, ensuring accurate and up-to-date tracking.
This platform supports both private and CTB buses, enabling bus owners to manage their fleets efficiently. Passengers can request the system to check the real-time location of a bus, and authorized users—such as bus drivers, assistants, or even passengers inside the bus—can update the location manually. This ensures that other waiting passengers can see where their bus is and plan accordingly.
The system accommodates two types of users: Bus Owners and Normal Users (Passengers). Bus owners can register their buses, assign routes, and manage their services, while passengers can search for buses, track their movement, and leave reviews for better service transparency.
With its user-friendly interface and real-time tracking, the Sri Lanka Bus Management System enhances commuter convenience, reduces waiting times, and improves public transport efficiency for both passengers and bus operators.
